# Reimagination Agent Update: Creative Freedom Mode

## Summary of Changes

The Reimagination Agent now supports **complete creative independence** when you provide a user prompt. Instead of just creating variations on a theme, it can now completely reimagine content based on your vision.

## What Changed

### 1. System Prompt (`src/ai_video/prompts/reimagination_agent_system_prompt.md`)

**New "Scene fidelity & creative freedom" section** with two modes:

- **Standard Mode** (default): Preserves original subjects, actions, and branded elements while varying style, mood, and aesthetics
- **Creative Reimagination Mode** (when user_prompt provided): User directive takes absolute precedence. You can completely reimagine subjects, locations, actions, and everything else. Original content is inspiration only.

**Updated priority hierarchy** that explicitly states:
1. User directives (HIGHEST in Creative Mode)
2. Global style
3. Source description (loose/ignored in Creative Mode if user directive conflicts)

### 2. Agent Logic (`src/ai_video/agents/reimagination_agent.py`)

**Mode detection:**
```python
is_creative_mode = bool(user_prompt)
```

**Payload now includes mode information:**
```python
"mode": "creative_reimagination" if is_creative_mode else "standard"
"creative_mode_enabled": is_creative_mode
"preserve_subject_action": not is_creative_mode  # False in creative mode
```

**Different instructions for each mode:**
- Standard: "Keep the original subject and action but explore new moods, palettes, and settings..."
- Creative: "CREATIVE REIMAGINATION MODE: This directive takes ABSOLUTE PRECEDENCE. You are not bound by the original scene's subject, action, location. Generate brand new subject matter, locations, actions, and compositions that fulfill the user's vision."

## How to Use It

### Standard Mode (Default)
```bash
ai-video reimagine --input prompts_detailed.md --style "cyberpunk tokyo"
```
Result: Same commercial reimagined with cyberpunk aesthetics

### Creative Reimagination Mode
```bash
ai-video reimagine \
  --input prompts_detailed.md \
  --user-prompt "Reimagine as if Spike Lee directed it. Channel hip-hop culture, streetwear, sports, and your iconic visual language. Build something completely new."
```
Result: Entirely new content channeling Spike Lee's creative vision

## Key Benefits

✅ **Complete Creative Freedom** - Not bound by original subjects or actions  
✅ **Full User Control** - User prompt takes absolute precedence  
✅ **Filmmaker/Genre Channeling** - "Reimagine as if [filmmaker] directed it"  
✅ **Multiple Unique Interpretations** - Each variant explores your vision differently  
✅ **Backward Compatible** - Standard mode works exactly as before  

## Example Use Case

User wants to recreate a commercial with Spike Lee's creative vision:

```bash
ai-video reimagine \
  --input assets/prompts/absurd_truth_in_passion/prompts_detailed.md \
  --style "90s Brooklyn street realism with Afrofuturist color" \
  --num-variants 4 \
  --user-prompt "You are the creative director Spike Lee. Channel your legendary body of work—hip-hop, streetwear, culture, music, sports, and 90s fashion. Draw inspiration from your most iconic films. Build something completely original that celebrates the rhythm, struggle, and beauty of urban life. Every scene should be independent—not reused or recycled—but inspired by the original as a creative blueprint."
```

**Result:** 4 completely independent scene interpretations, each capturing Spike Lee's creative vision, style, and cultural values. Not variations on the original—genuinely new creative content.

## Implementation Details

The changes ensure that:

1. When `user_prompt` is provided, the agent enters Creative Reimagination Mode
2. The system prompt explicitly instructs the model to prioritize the user's vision
3. The agent can freely change:
   - Subjects and characters
   - Locations and settings
   - Actions and narrative
   - Spatial composition
   - Branded elements (if user vision demands it)
4. Multiple variants each explore unique interpretations of the creative vision
5. Output format remains unchanged (JSON + Markdown reports)

## Testing the Changes

Try this to see the difference:

```bash
# Standard Mode - variations on a theme
ai-video reimagine --input assets/prompts/VIDEO_ID/prompts_detailed.md

# Creative Mode - completely independent reimagination
ai-video reimagine \
  --input assets/prompts/VIDEO_ID/prompts_detailed.md \
  --user-prompt "Complete creative freedom here - reimagine this as [your vision]"
```

Compare the output `variant_prompts.json` files to see how the mode affects the generated content.

## Files Modified

- `src/ai_video/prompts/reimagination_agent_system_prompt.md` - System instructions with dual-mode logic
- `src/ai_video/agents/reimagination_agent.py` - Agent logic with mode detection and conditional instructions
- `CREATIVE_REIMAGINATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive usage guide (new)

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All existing code is **100% backward compatible**. The agent automatically detects whether a user_prompt is provided and adjusts behavior accordingly. Existing workflows continue to work unchanged.
