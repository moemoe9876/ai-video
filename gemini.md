Image understanding

Gemini models are built to be multimodal from the ground up, unlocking a wide range of image processing and computer vision tasks including but not limited to image captioning, classification, and visual question answering without having to train specialized ML models.

Tip: In addition to their general multimodal capabilities, Gemini models (2.0 and newer) offer improved accuracy for specific use cases like object detection and segmentation, through additional training. See the Capabilities section for more details.
Passing images to Gemini
You can provide images as input to Gemini using two methods:

Passing inline image data: Ideal for smaller files (total request size less than 20MB, including prompts).
Uploading images using the File API: Recommended for larger files or for reusing images across multiple requests.
Passing inline image data
You can pass inline image data in the request to generateContent. You can provide image data as Base64 encoded strings or by reading local files directly (depending on the language).

The following example shows how to read an image from a local file and pass it to generateContent API for processing.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

  from google import genai
  from google.genai import types

  with open('path/to/small-sample.jpg', 'rb') as f:
      image_bytes = f.read()

  client = genai.Client()
  response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.5-flash',
    contents=[
      types.Part.from_bytes(
        data=image_bytes,
        mime_type='image/jpeg',
      ),
      'Caption this image.'
    ]
  )

  print(response.text)
You can also fetch an image from a URL, convert it to bytes, and pass it to generateContent as shown in the following examples.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

import requests

image_path = "https://goo.gle/instrument-img"
image_bytes = requests.get(image_path).content
image = types.Part.from_bytes(
  data=image_bytes, mime_type="image/jpeg"
)

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=["What is this image?", image],
)

print(response.text)
Note: Inline image data limits your total request size (text prompts, system instructions, and inline bytes) to 20MB. For larger requests, upload image files using the File API. Files API is also more efficient for scenarios that use the same image repeatedly.
Uploading images using the File API
For large files or to be able to use the same image file repeatedly, use the Files API. The following code uploads an image file and then uses the file in a call to generateContent. See the Files API guide for more information and examples.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

my_file = client.files.upload(file="path/to/sample.jpg")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[my_file, "Caption this image."],
)

print(response.text)
Prompting with multiple images
You can provide multiple images in a single prompt by including multiple image Part objects in the contents array. These can be a mix of inline data (local files or URLs) and File API references.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

# Upload the first image
image1_path = "path/to/image1.jpg"
uploaded_file = client.files.upload(file=image1_path)

# Prepare the second image as inline data
image2_path = "path/to/image2.png"
with open(image2_path, 'rb') as f:
    img2_bytes = f.read()

# Create the prompt with text and multiple images
response = client.models.generate_content(

    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[
        "What is different between these two images?",
        uploaded_file,  # Use the uploaded file reference
        types.Part.from_bytes(
            data=img2_bytes,
            mime_type='image/png'
        )
    ]
)

print(response.text)
Object detection
From Gemini 2.0 onwards, models are further trained to detect objects in an image and get their bounding box coordinates. The coordinates, relative to image dimensions, scale to [0, 1000]. You need to descale these coordinates based on your original image size.

Python

from google import genai
from google.genai import types
from PIL import Image
import json

client = genai.Client()
prompt = "Detect the all of the prominent items in the image. The box_2d should be [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax] normalized to 0-1000."

image = Image.open("/path/to/image.png")

config = types.GenerateContentConfig(
  response_mime_type="application/json"
  )

response = client.models.generate_content(model="gemini-2.5-flash",
                                          contents=[image, prompt],
                                          config=config
                                          )

width, height = image.size
bounding_boxes = json.loads(response.text)

converted_bounding_boxes = []
for bounding_box in bounding_boxes:
    abs_y1 = int(bounding_box["box_2d"][0]/1000 * height)
    abs_x1 = int(bounding_box["box_2d"][1]/1000 * width)
    abs_y2 = int(bounding_box["box_2d"][2]/1000 * height)
    abs_x2 = int(bounding_box["box_2d"][3]/1000 * width)
    converted_bounding_boxes.append([abs_x1, abs_y1, abs_x2, abs_y2])

print("Image size: ", width, height)
print("Bounding boxes:", converted_bounding_boxes)

Note: The model also supports generating bounding boxes based on custom instructions, such as: "Show bounding boxes of all green objects in this image". It also support custom labels like "label the items with the allergens they can contain".
For more examples, check following notebooks in the Gemini Cookbook:

2D spatial understanding notebook
Experimental 3D pointing notebook
Segmentation
Starting with Gemini 2.5, models not only detect items but also segment them and provide their contour masks.

The model predicts a JSON list, where each item represents a segmentation mask. Each item has a bounding box ("box_2d") in the format [y0, x0, y1, x1] with normalized coordinates between 0 and 1000, a label ("label") that identifies the object, and finally the segmentation mask inside the bounding box, as base64 encoded png that is a probability map with values between 0 and 255. The mask needs to be resized to match the bounding box dimensions, then binarized at your confidence threshold (127 for the midpoint).

Note: For better results, disable thinking by setting the thinking budget to 0. See code sample below for an example.

Supported image formats
Gemini supports the following image format MIME types:

PNG - image/png
JPEG - image/jpeg
WEBP - image/webp
HEIC - image/heic
HEIF - image/heif
Capabilities
All Gemini model versions are multimodal and can be utilized in a wide range of image processing and computer vision tasks including but not limited to image captioning, visual question and answering, image classification, object detection and segmentation.

Gemini can reduce the need to use specialized ML models depending on your quality and performance requirements.

Some later model versions are specifically trained improve accuracy of specialized tasks in addition to generic capabilities:

Gemini 2.0 models are further trained to support enhanced object detection.

Gemini 2.5 models are further trained to support enhanced segmentation in addition to object detection.

Limitations and key technical information
File limit
Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash, 2.0 Flash, 1.5 Pro, and 1.5 Flash support a maximum of 3,600 image files per request.

Token calculation
Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro: 258 tokens if both dimensions <= 384 pixels. Larger images are tiled (min tile 256px, max 768px, resized to 768x768), with each tile costing 258 tokens.
Gemini 2.0 Flash and Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro: 258 tokens if both dimensions <= 384 pixels. Larger images are tiled into 768x768 pixel tiles, each costing 258 tokens.
A rough formula for calculating the number of tiles is as follows:

Calculate the crop unit size which is roughly: floor(min(width, height) / 1.5).
Divide each dimension by the crop unit size and multiply together to get the number of tiles.
For example, for an image of dimensions 960x540 would have a crop unit size of 360. Divide each dimension by 360 and the number of tile is 3 * 2 = 6.

Tips and best practices
Verify that images are correctly rotated.
Use clear, non-blurry images.
When using a single image with text, place the text prompt after the image part in the contents array.
What's next
This guide shows you how to upload image files and generate text outputs from image inputs. To learn more, see the following resources:

Files API: Learn more about uploading and managing files for use with Gemini.
System instructions: System instructions let you steer the behavior of the model based on your specific needs and use cases.
File prompting strategies: The Gemini API supports prompting with text, image, audio, and video data, also known as multimodal prompting.
Safety guidance: Sometimes generative AI models produce unexpected outputs, such as outputs that are inaccurate, biased, or offensive. Post-processing and human evaluation are essential to limit the risk of harm from such outputs.

Send feedbackVideo understanding

Gemini models can process videos, enabling many frontier developer use cases that would have historically required domain specific models. Some of Gemini's vision capabilities include the ability to:

Describe, segment, and extract information from videos
Answer questions about video content
Refer to specific timestamps within a video
Gemini was built to be multimodal from the ground up and we continue to push the frontier of what is possible. This guide shows how to use the Gemini API to generate text responses based on video inputs.

Video input
You can provide videos as input to Gemini in the following ways:

Upload a video file using the File API before making a request to generateContent. Use this method for files larger than 20MB, videos longer than approximately 1 minute, or when you want to reuse the file across multiple requests.
Pass inline video data with the request to generateContent. Use this method for smaller files (<20MB) and shorter durations.
Pass YouTube URLs as part of your generateContent request.
Upload a video file
You can use the Files API to upload a video file. Always use the Files API when the total request size (including the file, text prompt, system instructions, etc.) is larger than 20 MB, the video duration is significant, or if you intend to use the same video in multiple prompts. The File API accepts video file formats directly.

The following code downloads the sample video, uploads it using the File API, waits for it to be processed, and then uses the file reference in a generateContent request.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

myfile = client.files.upload(file="path/to/sample.mp4")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash", contents=[myfile, "Summarize this video. Then create a quiz with an answer key based on the information in this video."]
)

print(response.text)
To learn more about working with media files, see Files API.

Pass video data inline
Instead of uploading a video file using the File API, you can pass smaller videos directly in the request to generateContent. This is suitable for shorter videos under 20MB total request size.

Here's an example of providing inline video data:

Python
JavaScript
REST

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

# Only for videos of size <20Mb
video_file_name = "/path/to/your/video.mp4"
video_bytes = open(video_file_name, 'rb').read()

client = genai.Client()
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='models/gemini-2.5-flash',
    contents=types.Content(
        parts=[
            types.Part(
                inline_data=types.Blob(data=video_bytes, mime_type='video/mp4')
            ),
            types.Part(text='Please summarize the video in 3 sentences.')
        ]
    )
)
Pass YouTube URLs
Preview: The YouTube URL feature is in preview and is available at no charge. Pricing and rate limits are likely to change.
You can pass YouTube URLs directly to Gemini API as part of your generateContentrequest as follows:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='models/gemini-2.5-flash',
    contents=types.Content(
        parts=[
            types.Part(
                file_data=types.FileData(file_uri='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hE5-98ZeCg')
            ),
            types.Part(text='Please summarize the video in 3 sentences.')
        ]
    )
)
Limitations:

For the free tier, you can't upload more than 8 hours of YouTube video per day.
For the paid tier, there is no limit based on video length.
For models prior to Gemini 2.5, you can upload only 1 video per request. For Gemini 2.5 and later models, you can upload a maximum of 10 videos per request.
You can only upload public videos (not private or unlisted videos).
Refer to timestamps in the content
You can ask questions about specific points in time within the video using timestamps of the form MM:SS.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

prompt = "What are the examples given at 00:05 and 00:10 supposed to show us?" # Adjusted timestamps for the NASA video
Transcribe video and provide visual descriptions
The Gemini models can transcribe and provide visual descriptions of video content by processing both the audio track and visual frames. For visual descriptions, the model samples the video at a rate of 1 frame per second. This sampling rate may affect the level of detail in the descriptions, particularly for videos with rapidly changing visuals.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

prompt = "Transcribe the audio from this video, giving timestamps for salient events in the video. Also provide visual descriptions."
Customize video processing
You can customize video processing in the Gemini API by setting clipping intervals or providing custom frame rate sampling.

Tip: Video clipping and frames per second (FPS) are supported by all models, but the quality is significantly higher from 2.5 series models.
Set clipping intervals
You can clip video by specifying videoMetadata with start and end offsets.

Python
JavaScript

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='models/gemini-2.5-flash',
    contents=types.Content(
        parts=[
            types.Part(
                file_data=types.FileData(file_uri='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEzRZ35urlk'),
                video_metadata=types.VideoMetadata(
                    start_offset='1250s',
                    end_offset='1570s'
                )
            ),
            types.Part(text='Please summarize the video in 3 sentences.')
        ]
    )
)
Set a custom frame rate
You can set custom frame rate sampling by passing an fps argument to videoMetadata.

Note: Due to built-in per image based safety checks, the same video may get blocked at some fps and not at others due to different extracted frames.
Python

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

# Only for videos of size <20Mb
video_file_name = "/path/to/your/video.mp4"
video_bytes = open(video_file_name, 'rb').read()

client = genai.Client()
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='models/gemini-2.5-flash',
    contents=types.Content(
        parts=[
            types.Part(
                inline_data=types.Blob(
                    data=video_bytes,
                    mime_type='video/mp4'),
                video_metadata=types.VideoMetadata(fps=5)
            ),
            types.Part(text='Please summarize the video in 3 sentences.')
        ]
    )
)
By default 1 frame per second (FPS) is sampled from the video. You might want to set low FPS (< 1) for long videos. This is especially useful for mostly static videos (e.g. lectures). If you want to capture more details in rapidly changing visuals, consider setting a higher FPS value.

Supported video formats
Gemini supports the following video format MIME types:

video/mp4
video/mpeg
video/mov
video/avi
video/x-flv
video/mpg
video/webm
video/wmv
video/3gpp
Technical details about videos
Supported models & context: All Gemini 2.0 and 2.5 models can process video data.
Models with a 2M context window can process videos up to 2 hours long at default media resolution or 6 hours long at low media resolution, while models with a 1M context window can process videos up to 1 hour long at default media resolution or 3 hours long at low media resolution.
File API processing: When using the File API, videos are stored at 1 frame per second (FPS) and audio is processed at 1Kbps (single channel). Timestamps are added every second.
These rates are subject to change in the future for improvements in inference.
You can override the 1 FPS sampling rate by setting a custom frame rate.
Token calculation: Each second of video is tokenized as follows:
Individual frames (sampled at 1 FPS):
If mediaResolution is set to low, frames are tokenized at 66 tokens per frame.
Otherwise, frames are tokenized at 258 tokens per frame.
Audio: 32 tokens per second.
Metadata is also included.
Total: Approximately 300 tokens per second of video at default media resolution, or 100 tokens per second of video at low media resolution.
Timestamp format: When referring to specific moments in a video within your prompt, use the MM:SS format (e.g., 01:15 for 1 minute and 15 seconds).
Best practices:
Use only one video per prompt request for optimal results.
If combining text and a single video, place the text prompt after the video part in the contents array.
Be aware that fast action sequences might lose detail due to the 1 FPS sampling rate. Consider slowing down such clips if necessary.
