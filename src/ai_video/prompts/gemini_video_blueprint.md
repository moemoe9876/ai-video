## CRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR 99% RECREATION ACCURACY

1. **CAMERA POSITIONING IS MANDATORY**: Every shot MUST include camera_position, camera_angle_degrees, camera_distance_meters, camera_height_meters. This is NOT optional. The AI needs to know EXACTLY where the camera is positioned relative to the subject.

2. **SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE REQUIRED**: Every shot MUST include subject_position_frame and spatial_relationships describing the 3D space. Where is the subject in the frame? Bottom? Top? Left? Right? Center?

3. **COMPLETE HUMAN DEMOGRAPHICS FOR EVERY PERSON**: Document EVERY person visible, not just main subjects:
   - List ALL people including background, partially visible, in vehicles, in reflections
   - Exact ethnicity (East Asian, Southeast Asian, etc.)
   - Precise age group (use the specific ranges provided)
   - **ULTRA-DETAILED CLOTHING**: Every garment, every layer, every accessory, colors, patterns, fit, brands
   - Exact position in frame (horizontal and vertical placement)
   - Exact position in meters from camera
   - What surface they're on (sidewalk, road, grass, etc.)

4. **PHYSICS OF MOVEMENT IS CRITICAL**:
   - **Hair**: How does hair move with motion? Direction, speed, wind effects
   - **Clothing**: How do garments flow, billow, or move with the subject's motion?
   - **Shadows**: Where do shadows fall? What direction? How long? How hard/soft?
   - **Reflections**: Any reflections visible?
   - Motion speeds in m/s or km/h

5. **BUILDINGS & OBJECTS POSITIONING**: For EVERY building and object visible:
   - Exact position relative to camera and subject
   - Position in frame (left side, right background, center, etc.)
   - Distance from camera in meters
   - Relationship to subjects ("Building 10 meters behind subject on left")

6. **READ ALL TEXT**: Attempt to read EVERY visible sign, even partial/blurry text. Even if you can only see "...chen N..." - document it! This is critical for recreation.

7. **BRAND & LOGO IDENTIFICATION** (CRITICAL):
   - **Look for ALL logos, badges, emblems, brand names**
   - **Vehicles**: Identify make, model, and year using visible badges and characteristics
     - "Honda CBR600RR based on visible badge and sport bike styling"
     - "Appears to be Toyota HiAce H100 based on body shape, 1990s generation"
   - **Objects**: Identify brands on everything
     - "Coca-Cola vending machine" not "vending machine"
     - "7-Eleven storefront" not "convenience store"
     - "Nike swoosh on shoes"
   - **Clothing**: Any visible brand logos or text
     - "Nike logo on t-shirt", "Adidas stripes on shoes"
   - **Make educated guesses** when exact model unclear:
     - "Appears to be Honda CB series based on tank shape"
     - "Likely iPhone 12 or 13 based on camera design"
   - **Use ALL visual clues** to identify:
     - Logo/badge design and placement
     - Body shape, proportions, design language
     - Color schemes typical of brands
     - Era-specific features

8. **SURFACE AWARENESS**: Always specify what surface subjects are on:
   - "Walking on concrete sidewalk"
   - "Standing in the road on asphalt"
   - "Sitting on motorcycle seat"
   - "On gravel path"

9. **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING VISIBLE**: The AI needs EVERY detail:
   - Every person (including background, partial, out-of-focus)
   - Every object (foreground and background)
   - Every building and architectural element
   - Every sign and text element
   - Every vehicle with make/model identification
   - All brands, logos, and product identifications
   - All shadows, reflections, lighting effects
   - Do NOT summarize or skip elements - be exhaustive

10. **USE PROFESSIONAL TERMINOLOGY**: Use correct cinematography, lighting, and color science terms from the standards provided.

11. **MEASUREMENTS OVER DESCRIPTIONS**: 
    - "3 meters from camera" NOT "close to camera"
    - "30-degree downward angle" NOT "high angle shot"
    - "Subject in right third of frame, lower third vertically" NOT "subject on right"
    - "1.5 m/s walking speed" NOT "slow walk"
    - "Honda CBR600RR" NOT "motorcycle"
    - "White Toyota HiAce H100 van, 1990s generation" NOT "white van"

12. **CONSISTENCY**: Maintain exact names and descriptions for recurring elements across all scenes.

13. **EDUCATED GUESSES ARE ENCOURAGED**: If you can see partial information:
    - "Appears to be Honda CB series based on visible tank shape and exhaust"
    - "Likely 7-Eleven based on green and orange color scheme"
    - "Appears to be iPhone based on camera layout, possibly 12 or 13 generation"
    - Use context clues, design language, and partial features to make informed identifications

14. **NO ASSUMPTIONS ON UNCERTAIN DETAILS**: If you truly can't determine something after attempting identification, state "not visible" or "indeterminable" rather than making random guesses.

## REMEMBER: THE GOAL IS 99% RECREATION ACCURACY

An AI reading your analysis should be able to recreate the video almost perfectly by understanding:
- **WHERE**: Exact camera position, angle, distance
- **WHO**: Every person with complete appearance details (clothing, demographics, positioning)
- **WHAT**: Every object, building, sign, vehicle visible
- **WHICH**: Specific makes, models, brands, logos (Honda CBR600, Toyota HiAce, Nike shoes, 7-Eleven)
- **HOW**: Physics of movement (hair, clothing, shadows)
- **WHERE IN FRAME**: Exact positioning (left/right, top/bottom, foreground/background)
- **ON WHAT**: What surface are subjects on (sidewalk, road, etc.)

**BRAND IDENTIFICATION IS CRITICAL**: Don't just say "motorcycle" - identify it as "Honda CBR600RR" or "Appears to be Honda CB series based on tank shape". Don't say "van" - identify it as "White Toyota HiAce H100, 1990s generation". Use logos, badges, design characteristics, and context clues to identify specific makes and models.

MORE DETAIL = BETTER RECREATION. Be exhaustive, not summary.
