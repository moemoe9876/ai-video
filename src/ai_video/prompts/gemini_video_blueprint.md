## MISSION CRITICAL: Near-Perfect Recreation (99% Accuracy Target)

Your analysis must be SO DETAILED that an AI model reading it can recreate the video with 99% accuracy. This requires:

### 1. **CAMERA POSITIONING & MOVEMENT (EXTREME PRECISION)**
For EVERY shot, describe:

  - "Camera positioned approximately 2-3 meters in front of subject, offset 1 meter to the right"
  - "Camera at subject's eye level, approximately 1.6 meters from ground"
  - "Camera positioned behind and above subject, approximately 4 meters back, 2.5 meters high"
- **Camera Angle (in degrees when possible)**:
  - "Looking down at subject at approximately 30-degree angle (high angle)"
  - "Eye-level, straight-on perspective (0 degrees)"
  - "Looking up at approximately 15-degree angle (low angle)"
  - "Dutch angle, tilted 10 degrees counterclockwise"
- **Camera Distance from Subject**:
  - Close: 0.5-1.5 meters
  - Medium: 1.5-4 meters
  - Far: 4-10 meters
  - Very far/establishing: 10+ meters
- **Lateral Position**:
  - Centered on subject
  - Left of center by X meters
  - Right of frame, subject at left edge
  - Extreme left/right composition
- **Camera Movement Trajectory**:

## CRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR 99% RECREATION ACCURACY

1. **CAMERA POSITIONING IS MANDATORY**: Every shot MUST include camera_position, camera_angle_degrees, camera_distance_meters, camera_height_meters. This is NOT optional.

2. **SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE REQUIRED**: Every shot MUST include subject_position_frame and spatial_relationships describing the 3D space.

3. **COMPLETE HUMAN DEMOGRAPHICS**: For EVERY person visible, specify:
   - Exact ethnicity (East Asian, Southeast Asian, etc.)
   - Precise age group (use the specific ranges provided)
   - Complete clothing inventory
   - Exact position in meters from camera

4. **READ ALL TEXT**: Attempt to read EVERY visible sign, even partial text. This is critical for recreation.

5. **PHYSICS & MOTION**: Describe motion speed in meters/second or km/h. Describe weight, momentum, gait characteristics.

6. **BE EXHAUSTIVE**: The AI needs EVERY detail to recreate accurately. More detail = better recreation. Do NOT summarize or skip elements.

7. **USE PROFESSIONAL TERMINOLOGY**: Use correct cinematography, lighting, and color science terms from the standards provided.

8. **MEASUREMENTS OVER DESCRIPTIONS**: "3 meters from camera" is better than "close to camera". "30-degree angle" is better than "slight angle".

9. **CONSISTENCY**: Maintain exact names and descriptions for recurring elements across all scenes.

10. **NO ASSUMPTIONS**: If you can't determine something, state "not visible" or "indeterminable" rather than guessing.
