## ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE YOU START: MANDATORY FIELD CHECKLIST

**These fields MUST be populated for EVERY scene/shot. NULL is NOT ACCEPTABLE:**

‚úÖ **For EVERY Scene - REQUIRED (NEVER null):**
- `lighting`: Description of light sources and quality (e.g., "Bright natural sunlight from left, soft shadows")
- `lighting_type`: Specific type (e.g., "Natural daylight", "Fluorescent", "Mixed artificial")
- `lighting_direction`: Where light comes from (e.g., "From upper right, 45-degree angle")

- `motion_physics` - DESCRIBE how hair, clothing, shadows move!
- `texture_details` - DESCRIBE surface textures you can see!

**If a scene has people but human_subjects is null ‚Üí INCOMPLETE**
**If a scene has environment but physical_world is null ‚Üí INCOMPLETE**
**If ANY of the above fields are null ‚Üí INCOMPLETE**

## CRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR 99% RECREATION ACCURACY

1. **CAMERA POSITIONING IS MANDATORY**: Every shot MUST include camera_position, camera_angle_degrees, camera_distance_meters, camera_height_meters. This is NOT optional. The AI needs to know EXACTLY where the camera is positioned relative to the subject.

2. **SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE REQUIRED**: Every shot MUST include subject_position_frame and spatial_relationships describing the 3D space. Where is the subject in the frame? Bottom? Top? Left? Right? Center?

3. **COMPLETE HUMAN DEMOGRAPHICS FOR EVERY PERSON**: Document EVERY person visible, not just main subjects:
   - List ALL people including background, partially visible, in vehicles, in reflections
   - Exact ethnicity (East Asian, Southeast Asian, etc.)
   - Precise age group (use the specific ranges provided)
   - **ULTRA-DETAILED CLOTHING**: Every garment, every layer, every accessory, colors, patterns, fit, brands
   - Exact position in frame (horizontal and vertical placement)
   - Exact position in meters from camera
   - What surface they're on (sidewalk, road, grass, etc.)
   - **When 2+ people together**: Describe exact physical relationship and body positioning (see detailed examples in section 3)

4. **START AND END STATES FOR MOVEMENT** (CRITICAL for video generation):
   For ANY scene with movement or transformation, clearly describe:
   - **Starting state**: Where subject/object begins (position, distance, orientation)
   - **Ending state**: Where subject/object ends (position, distance, orientation)
   - **Transformation**: How they move from start to end
   - Example: "Subject STARTS at 8m from camera in background, WALKS forward approaching camera, ENDS at 2m in foreground"
   - This enables generation of precise first and last frame images for Kling 2.1 Pro

5. **PHYSICS OF MOVEMENT IS CRITICAL**:
   - **Hair**: How does hair move with motion? Direction, speed, wind effects
   - **Clothing**: How do garments flow, billow, or move with the subject's motion?
   - **Shadows**: Where do shadows fall? What direction? How long? How hard/soft?
   - **Reflections**: Any reflections visible?
   - Motion speeds in m/s or km/h

6. **BUILDINGS & ENVIRONMENTAL SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS** (CRITICAL):
   For EVERY building and object, describe:
   - **Building aesthetics**: Style, era, materials, colors, height, unique identifiers
   - **Position relative to SUBJECT**: Distance, direction, which side
     - "Building 5 meters behind subject", "Building to subject's right"
   - **Position relative to CAMERA**: Distance, angle, frame placement
     - "Building 20m from camera, fills left side of frame"
   - **Subject's movement relative to building**:
     - "Subject walking toward building entrance"
     - "Subject walking parallel to building facade, 2m from wall"
     - "Subject passing building on right side"
   - **Complete spatial mapping**: Foreground, midground, background depth layers with distances
   - **Environmental physics**: Scale, proportions, spatial layout
     - "Building is 3x taller than subject"
     - "Alley is 3 meters wide"

7. **READ ALL TEXT**: Attempt to read EVERY visible sign, even partial/blurry text. Even if you can only see "...chen N..." - document it! This is critical for recreation.

8. **BRAND & LOGO IDENTIFICATION** (CRITICAL):
   - **Look for ALL logos, badges, emblems, brand names**
   - **Vehicles**: Identify make, model, and year using visible badges and characteristics
     - "Honda CBR600RR based on visible badge and sport bike styling"
     - "Appears to be Toyota HiAce H100 based on body shape, 1990s generation"
   - **Objects**: Identify brands on everything
     - "Coca-Cola vending machine" not "vending machine"
     - "7-Eleven storefront" not "convenience store"
     - "Nike swoosh on shoes"
   - **Clothing**: Any visible brand logos or text
     - "Nike logo on t-shirt", "Adidas stripes on shoes"
   - **Make educated guesses** when exact model unclear:
     - "Appears to be Honda CB series based on tank shape"
     - "Likely iPhone 12 or 13 based on camera design"
   - **Use ALL visual clues** to identify:
     - Logo/badge design and placement
     - Body shape, proportions, design language
     - Color schemes typical of brands
     - Era-specific features

9. **SURFACE AWARENESS**: Always specify what surface subjects are on:
   - "Walking on concrete sidewalk"
   - "Standing in the road on asphalt"
   - "Sitting on motorcycle seat"
   - "On gravel path"

10. **BODY POSITIONING & PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS** (CRITICAL for 2+ people):
   When multiple people are together, describe EXACT physical relationship:
   - How they're positioned relative to each other (side-by-side, front-back, distance apart)
   - Physical contact points: "Arms wrapped around waist", "Holding hands", "Shoulder touching"
   - Coordinated movement: "Both leaning forward together on motorcycle"
   - Body angles relative to each other: "Person A faces 0¬∞, Person B faces 270¬∞"
   - Use detailed examples from section 3 (motorcycle riders, walking together, etc.)

11. **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING VISIBLE**: The AI needs EVERY detail:
   - Every person (including background, partial, out-of-focus)
   - Every object (foreground and background)
   - Every building and architectural element
   - Every sign and text element
   - Every vehicle with make/model identification
   - All brands, logos, and product identifications
   - All shadows, reflections, lighting effects
   - All spatial RELATIONSHIPS (subject to building, subject to objects, subjects to each other)
   - Do NOT summarize or skip elements - be exhaustive

12. **USE PROFESSIONAL TERMINOLOGY**: Use correct cinematography, lighting, and color science terms from the standards provided.

13. **MEASUREMENTS OVER DESCRIPTIONS**: 
    - "3 meters from camera" NOT "close to camera"
    - "30-degree downward angle" NOT "high angle shot"
    - "Subject in right third of frame, lower third vertically" NOT "subject on right"
    - "1.5 m/s walking speed" NOT "slow walk"
    - "Honda CBR600RR" NOT "motorcycle"
    - "White Toyota HiAce H100 van, 1990s generation" NOT "white van"
    - "Building 5 meters behind subject" NOT "building in background"
    - "Driver leans forward 15¬∞, passenger matches angle" NOT "both leaning"
    - "STARTS at 8m, ENDS at 2m" NOT "gets closer"

14. **CONSISTENCY**: Maintain exact names and descriptions for recurring elements across all scenes.

15. **EDUCATED GUESSES ARE ENCOURAGED**: If you can see partial information:
    - "Appears to be Honda CB series based on visible tank shape and exhaust"
    - "Likely 7-Eleven based on green and orange color scheme"
    - "Appears to be iPhone based on camera layout, possibly 12 or 13 generation"
    - Use context clues, design language, and partial features to make informed identifications

16. **NO ASSUMPTIONS ON UNCERTAIN DETAILS**: If you truly can't determine something after attempting identification, state "not visible" or "indeterminable" rather than making random guesses.

---

## REMEMBER: THE GOAL IS 99% RECREATION ACCURACY

An AI reading your analysis should be able to recreate the video almost perfectly by understanding:

**SPATIAL POSITIONING & RELATIONSHIPS:**
- **WHERE**: Exact camera position, angle, distance
- **WHO**: Every person with complete appearance details (clothing, demographics, positioning)
- **WHAT**: Every object, building, sign, vehicle visible
- **WHICH**: Specific makes, models, brands, logos (Honda CBR600, Toyota HiAce, Nike shoes, 7-Eleven)
- **HOW**: Physics of movement (hair, clothing, shadows)
- **WHERE IN FRAME**: Exact positioning (left/right, top/bottom, foreground/background)
- **ON WHAT**: What surface are subjects on (sidewalk, road, etc.)

**PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIPS (CRITICAL):**
- **Subject to Subject**: When 2+ people together, describe exact physical relationship
  - "Female passenger on motorcycle, arms wrapped around driver's waist, both leaning forward 15¬∞"
  - "Walking side-by-side, 0.5m apart, Person A's shoulder ahead by 0.3m"
- **Subject to Building**: Position and movement relative to buildings
  - "Subject walks toward building entrance, 3 meters from door"
  - "Building 5 meters behind subject, fills left third of frame"
  - "Subject walking parallel to building facade, 2m from wall"
- **Subject to Objects**: How subject relates to vehicles, objects in space
  - "Subject passes between foreground van (2m away) and background building (10m away)"
- **Complete World Physics**: Scale, proportions, spatial layout
  - "Building is 3x taller than subject"
  - "Alley is 3 meters wide (1.5 van widths)"

**BUILDING AESTHETICS & ENVIRONMENT:**
- Building style, era, materials, colors, height
- Unique identifiers: balconies, signage, window patterns, facade details
- Environmental physics: How everything relates spatially in the 3D world

**BRAND IDENTIFICATION IS CRITICAL**: Don't just say "motorcycle" - identify it as "Honda CBR600RR" or "Appears to be Honda CB series based on tank shape".
