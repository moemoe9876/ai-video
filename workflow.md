AI Agents Pipeline for Automated Video Recreation
Overview and Objectives
We propose a multi-agent AI framework that deconstructs an input video and recreates it using generative models. The goal is to automate the process so that AI agents analyze the original footage, generate text prompts, create key images, and synthesize video clips which a human can assemble into the final video. This pipeline is designed for short creative videos (e.g. 10–20 second ads or film clips) and acts like a “digital creative director,” producing a storyboard and visuals that closely mimic the original video’s content and style. The system leverages Gemini 2.5 Pro for video understanding, Seed Dream 4.0 for text-to-image generation, and Kling 2.5 Pro (or Kling 2.1 Pro / Google Veo 3) for image-to-video synthesis.
Multi-Agent System Architecture
We organize the solution into specialized agents, each with a distinct role, working in sequence:
1. Video Analysis Agent (Gemini 2.5 Pro): Ingests the original video and analyzes its content. This agent uses Gemini’s state-of-the-art video understanding to identify the video’s structure (scenes/shots, key moments), subjects (characters, objects), actions, and even stylistic elements. Gemini 2.5 can accurately segment a video into distinct events or scenes using audio-visual cues
developers.googleblog.com
. It produces a “video blueprint” – a detailed description or spec of each scene (e.g. scene boundaries, what happens, camera angles, moods). For example, given a prompt to analyze a video, Gemini 2.5 can return a structured spec highlighting key ideas and moments in order
developers.googleblog.com
.
2. Prompt Generation Agent (Prompt Engineer): Takes the analysis output and crafts text prompts for image and video generation. For each scene identified, this agent formulates a descriptive prompt that captures the scene’s content, style, and camera perspective. It ensures the prompts include crucial details (e.g. subject’s appearance, background setting, lighting, action) so that the generative models can recreate the scene faithfully. The agent may also incorporate creative directives akin to a filmmaker’s notes – for instance, specifying camera movements (“a wide-angle shot panning slowly across a sunset beach”) or visual style (“cinematic lighting, vibrant colors”). These prompts aim to “match” the original scene’s look and feel, based on Gemini’s understanding. The Prompt Engineer can further refine prompts using language-model capabilities (Gemini or another LLM) to balance conciseness and detail.
3. Image Generation Agent (Seed Dream 4.0): Uses each text prompt to generate keyframe images that represent the scene. Seed Dream 4.0 is a powerful text-to-image model that can produce high-resolution (up to 4K) images quickly

. For each scene, this agent typically generates: (a) a first-frame image depicting the scene’s beginning state, (b) a last-frame image depicting the scene’s ending state, and possibly (c) a few intermediate or alternate shots if needed. Seed Dream 4.0 is well-suited for this because it can output up to nine related images in one go and accepts multiple reference inputs for consistency
aikolhub.com
. Crucially, it can preserve characters and details across images – the model “remembers” faces/objects and maintains them even if we switch styles or camera angles
aikolhub.com
. We exploit this by feeding reference images (e.g. the main character’s image from a prior scene) into Seed Dream when generating the next scene’s frames, ensuring the subject looks consistent throughout the video. The result of this stage is a set of high-quality keyframe images for every scene (e.g. scene1_first.png, scene1_last.png, … for Scene 1, Scene 2, etc.), along with the text prompts used. These images essentially form an AI-generated storyboard of the video.
4. Video Synthesis Agent (Kling 2.5 Pro / Veo 3): This agent turns static images into animated video clips. We use Kling (an advanced image-to-video and text-to-video model) or alternatively Google’s Veo 3 for this task. For each scene, the agent takes the first-frame and last-frame images from Seed Dream, plus the scene’s prompt, and feeds them into the video model to generate a video clip. Kling 2.1 Pro and newer versions support first-frame and last-frame conditioning, meaning the generated clip will start exactly at the first image and end at the last image
help.scenario.com
. This creates a smooth transition between the two keyframes, effectively animating the scene. For example, if Scene 1 begins with a person at a doorway and ends with them on a street, we supply those two images; Kling will synthesize a ~5–10 second clip interpolating the person walking out the door onto the street, guided by the prompt. Kling models excel at producing fluid, natural motion without the jitter artifacts common in older video models
help.scenario.com
. They also handle character motion well, preserving the character’s identity and expressions through the clip
help.scenario.com
. We set the prompt guidance high enough to keep visual fidelity to the scene description
help.scenario.com
. If needed, we include camera directives in the prompt (Kling 2.x can interpret instructions for pans, zooms, etc., especially in Pro versions
help.scenario.com
). Veo 3, similarly, can generate short cinematic videos from either text or an image input; it’s capable of animating a given image into a coherent video clip with natural motion and even adds audio by default
easemate.ai

. The output of this stage is a set of video segments (e.g. scene1_clip.mp4, scene2_clip.mp4, …), each ideally matching the original scene’s content and duration.
5. Orchestration & Editing Agent (Director): This “agent” can be an automated coordinator or the human user overseeing the process. Its role is to coordinate the pipeline (ensuring each agent’s output feeds into the next) and to perform final assembly. It keeps track of the timeline/sequence of scenes, collating the generated clips in order. In practice, the human user often acts as this director agent – reviewing prompts, tweaking them if needed, and finally stitching the clips together. The assembly might involve simple editing like concatenating clips and adding cross-fade transitions or adjusting timing so that the final video flows seamlessly. The Director also handles any quality control: if a generated element is unsatisfactory (e.g. an image with distortions, or a video clip with an off-model frame), it can loop back in the pipeline – requesting the Prompt Agent to adjust the prompt or re-running the generation with different seeds/settings. The end result is the reconstructed video, composed of the AI-generated scenes in sequence, which should resemble the original video’s narrative and style.
Artifacts and Data Flow: Throughout this pipeline, each agent’s outputs are saved and passed along. For clarity, the process produces intermediate files like:
analysis_spec.json (or .txt): structured output from Gemini describing scene-by-scene breakdown (including timestamps, descriptions, dialogue if any, etc.).
scene1_prompt.txt, scene2_prompt.txt, ...: text prompts for each scene’s content/style.
For each scene i: scene{i}_first.png and scene{i}_last.png (keyframe images from Seed Dream), plus any additional reference frames or variations (scene{i}_alt1.png, etc.).
scene{i}_clip.mp4: video clip generated by Kling/Veo for scene i. (Clip lengths would be specified based on original scene lengths, often 5–10 seconds each due to model limits).
assembly_timeline.txt or edit_decisions.txt: an outline of how clips are ordered and transitions, derived from the original video’s timeline (this can be as simple as a list of clips in order, since we aim to recreate exactly).
final_reconstructed_video.mp4: the final compiled video after stitching all scene clips together (this might be done outside the AI agents by the user in a video editor, using the generated footage).
All agents operate within a framework that allows passing these files and data structures along – for example, a central orchestrator script or an Agent Management system (like Google’s Agent Engine or a custom pipeline) coordinates the calls to each model in turn.
Workflow Pipeline (Step-by-Step)
The following steps summarize how the agents collaborate to go from an original video to a recreated AI-generated video:
Video Ingestion and Deconstruction: The process begins with the Video Analysis Agent loading the original video (e.g. via a YouTube link or file input). Gemini 2.5 Pro is prompted with instructions to analyze the video’s content and structure. For example, we might ask Gemini: “Summarize the video’s scenes, describe the setting, actors, actions, and any notable visual details or camera angles for each segment.” Gemini 2.5 processes the video (it can handle videos up to ~45–60 minutes if needed
cloud.google.com
cloud.google.com
, far more than our short clip) and produces a detailed breakdown. This includes splitting the video into distinct scenes or shots (Gemini is very accurate at moment segmentation
developers.googleblog.com
), and giving each a textual description. For instance, for a 15-second ad, Gemini might identify 3 scenes: Scene 1 (0-5s): A woman enters a kitchen, morning light; camera follows her. Scene 2 (5-10s): Close-up of coffee cup, she smiles; warm color tone. Scene 3 (10-15s): Product shot of coffee machine with company logo; upbeat mood. Each scene description might also note the “subject” (main character or object), the background, motion (walking, pouring coffee), and style (lighting, atmosphere). This forms the “blueprint” that subsequent agents will use. (If the video has audio or dialogue, Gemini can also transcribe and summarize key lines, but here we focus on visuals.)
Scene Prompt Creation: Next, the Prompt Generation Agent converts each scene’s description into a creative prompt for image generation. It takes Gemini’s output for Scene 1, for example, and formulates a concise yet detailed text prompt capturing that scene. This involves phrasing the description in a way that a text-to-image model will understand. For instance, if Scene 1 was described as “Woman enters a sunlit kitchen, camera tracking from behind as she walks,” the prompt might be: “A cinematic shot of a woman walking into a cozy kitchen in the morning light, viewed from behind. Warm sunlight spills through the window, realistic shadows on the floor, soft focus.” The agent ensures to include the artistic style (e.g. “cinematic, warm lighting, realistic detail”) to guide Seed Dream 4.0. It also maintains consistent language for the main character or subject across prompts so that the image model knows it’s the same person or object reappearing. We might assign identifiers (e.g. “the woman with curly brown hair” consistently in every prompt where she appears). Additionally, if the original ad had a particular color palette or mood, the prompt should reflect that (e.g. “bright and cheerful” or “dramatic contrast, high-key lighting”). The Prompt Agent effectively acts as a translator between the video analysis and the image generation, ensuring that each prompt will yield an image that aligns with the original scene’s content.
Key Frame Image Generation: With prompts ready, the Image Generation Agent uses Seed Dream 4.0 to create key visuals for each scene. For Scene 1, the agent sends the prompt (from step 2) to Seed Dream and requests multiple images: importantly, a start frame and end frame of the scene. The start frame might correspond to the scene’s opening moment (e.g. the woman just at the kitchen entrance) and the end frame to the scene’s final moment (e.g. the woman at the counter with a coffee mug). If Gemini’s analysis provided thumbnails or descriptions of actual first/last frames, we use those as guidance for what each image should depict. Seed Dream can generate these in one batch (it supports generating a series of related images from one prompt
aikolhub.com
). We also take advantage of reference conditioning in Seed Dream: for example, if Scene 1 and Scene 2 both feature the same woman, we input the woman’s image from Scene 1 as a reference when generating Scene 2’s frames. This leverages Seed Dream 4.0’s multi-image input capability to maintain character consistency across scenes
aikolhub.com
. The outcome is a set of high-resolution images for each scene, which are effectively an AI-drawn storyboard of the video
aikolhub.com
. At this point, we review the images: they should reflect the scene descriptions and have continuity (the woman’s appearance should match in all scenes, etc.). If anything is off (say a detail is incorrect), the Prompt Agent can refine the text and regenerate. We save these images with clear names (e.g. scene2_first.png, scene2_last.png, etc.) for use in the next step.
Video Clip Generation: Now each scene’s static visuals will be turned into motion. The Video Synthesis Agent processes one scene at a time. For each scene, we feed the prompt (from step 2) along with that scene’s first and last images into the Kling model (or Veo 3 as an alternative). Kling 2.1 Pro/2.5 Pro can take an initial frame and final frame to guide the video generation
help.scenario.com
. The agent sets the desired duration (e.g. 5 seconds if the original Scene 1 was ~5 seconds long – Kling supports up to 10s per clip
help.scenario.com
). The model then generates a video clip that starts at the first image and organically transitions to the last image. This is crucial: it ensures the clip begins and ends exactly as our storyboard frames, so when we later stitch scenes together, the transition from one clip to the next will match the original cut. For instance, Scene 1’s last frame (woman at counter) should match Scene 2’s first frame (woman at counter from a new angle) if the original video cut on that moment – and by using the same image in both Scene 1’s last and Scene 2’s first, we maintain that continuity. Kling’s strength in motion fluidity means the movement between the keyframes will look smooth and natural
help.scenario.com
 rather than a sudden jump. We also include the text prompt so that Kling can fill in any details not explicitly shown in the keyframes (e.g. if the woman is supposed to smile and pick up a cup, the prompt would say that, and Kling will animate that action). The model’s strong adherence to prompts ensures the generated clip respects these instructions
help.scenario.com
. If using Veo 3, a similar approach is taken: we can provide the initial image (and possibly the final image by splitting the video into two parts if needed) or just rely on the prompt. Veo 3 is capable of generating high-quality 1080p video with coherent motion and even automatic audio (like background music) from a text prompt
fal.ai
easemate.ai
. In either case, the agent produces the scene’s video segment. Each clip is reviewed – we check that the content matches the intended action and the visuals are consistent (no odd new elements appearing). If a clip is not satisfactory, the agent can retry with adjusted settings (for example, using a higher prompt strength or a different random seed in Kling to improve coherence). We repeat this for all scenes. The output is a collection of scene clips (scene1_clip.mp4, scene2_clip.mp4, ...). For longer videos, note that each Kling/Veo generation is limited in length (Kling typically max 10s
help.scenario.com
, Veo often ~8s by default), so a longer video is naturally segmented into multiple chunks which we are already doing per scene. If one scene itself is longer than the model limit, we would further subdivide that scene (e.g. generate it in two consecutive parts using an intermediate frame as bridge).
Compilation and Post-Processing: Finally, the Director/Orchestrator agent (or the human operator) compiles the generated clips into the full video. At this stage, all the pieces are in place to reconstruct the sequence. The agent orders the clips according to the original timeline (e.g. Scene 1 clip followed by Scene 2 clip, etc.). If the original video had hard cuts between scenes, we simply butt the clips together. If there were transitions (like a fade-out/in or a cross-dissolve), the human editor can apply similar transitions between the AI clips for a professional touch. We also consider color grading and style consistency in post-processing: while the prompts aimed to keep style consistent, slight differences might occur. A pass through a video editing tool to adjust color tone or contrast can help ensure the final assembled video looks uniform, like a single piece of content rather than separate AI clips. Additionally, if the video requires graphics or text overlays (e.g. a brand logo at the end), it’s usually best to add those manually at this stage because generative models often struggle with exact text/logo reproduction. The Director agent thus adds any final assets (perhaps using an image editing model or just standard editing software). The end result is the recreated video, hopefully a close visual approximation of the original. The agents have automatically handled the heavy lifting – analyzing scenes and generating content – while the human overseer ensures quality and handles any final tweaks.
Challenges and Considerations in Video Recreation
Reconstructing a video with AI involves several challenges. We outline key considerations and how our plan addresses them:
Consistency of Characters and Objects: A major issue is keeping the same look for the subject (e.g. the main actor or product) across all frames and scenes. Pure text-to-image generation can introduce small changes (e.g. the character’s face might look different in each image). We mitigate this with Seed Dream 4.0’s multi-image capabilities – by using reference images and multi-output generation, the model “maintains the scene and characters” across a series of images
aikolhub.com
. Moreover, Kling’s video generation inherently keeps the character consistent within each clip (it animates from the provided image of that character). To maintain consistency across clips, we reuse keyframes between scenes (the end of one and start of the next) whenever the original video’s scenes connect. If needed for longer gaps, we could also feed a reference frame of the character into Kling’s next clip (Kling can do image initialization for the first frame). Preserving identity is something these models are getting good at – for example, Kling 2.x was designed for strong character continuity in animation
help.scenario.com
, and Seed Dream can retain facial details across style changes
aikolhub.com
. Still, in practice we might need a few prompt tweaks (explicitly describing the character’s key features each time) or even fine-tuning via a DreamBooth-like approach if an exact real person likeness is needed (though that goes beyond our default pipeline).
Temporal Coherence and Motion Artifacts: Generating smooth video without flicker or weird transitions is challenging for AI. Kling models specifically address this by producing superior motion quality that avoids jitter
help.scenario.com
. Using first-and-last frame conditioning helps ensure a stable trajectory from start to end of each clip. However, if the first and last frames differ greatly, the model might struggle or introduce distortions mid-way. One has to consider how to split the scenes: if a scene is too complex (a long action or a complex camera move), it might be better to break it into smaller sub-clips. Our workflow’s reliance on actual keyframes from the scene provides a strong structural guide to the video model, reducing randomness. If minor flicker still occurs, a post-process like frame interpolation or even a mild motion stabilization filter could be applied, but in many cases Kling’s output is already smooth. Veo 3 similarly focuses on natural motion and coherence, as it’s a state-of-the-art model by Google (known for realistic results in their demos). We also keep clip lengths within the supported 5–10s window to avoid pushing the models beyond their comfort zone
help.scenario.com
.
Prompt Quality and Scene Detail: The fidelity of the recreated video hinges on how well the prompts capture the original scenes. One problem is that an automated analysis might miss subtle details (e.g. a small object in the background, or the exact framing of a shot). We must ensure the Prompt Generation Agent is thorough. Gemini’s analysis gives us the big picture and often fine details (it can pick up specific moments and elements very accurately in video
developers.googleblog.com
), but the human overseer might need to verify critical details. If the original video has a very distinctive art style (say a cartoon or a surreal color filter), describing that in the prompt is crucial so that Seed Dream reproduces it. We consider using style reference images if available – Seed Dream 4.0 could take a style image along with the text prompt to mimic a particular color grading or art style. The Prompt Agent might also employ iterative refinement: e.g., after seeing Seed Dream’s first output, adjust the prompt to better match the target (maybe the lighting was too warm, etc., so add “cooler lighting” to prompt and regenerate). This iteration is part of the creative/directorial process. The good news is Seed Dream 4.0’s faster generation (2K image in ~1.8s
aikolhub.com
) allows quick trial-and-error if needed.
Limitations of AI Models: Each model has strengths and weaknesses we must work around. Gemini 2.5 Pro can analyze long videos and generate structured outputs, but it’s an expensive model to run and may not perfectly describe highly visual nuances (it might focus on obvious actions and spoken content if any). We address this by tailoring Gemini’s prompt to focus on visual details (“describe the scenery, colors, camera motion, etc.”). Seed Dream 4.0 produces high-quality images, but like any generative model, it might struggle with very specific logos/text or extremely complex scenes with many people (could blur faces if too many). It also requires significant VRAM for large batches or high resolutions
aikolhub.com
. In our pipeline, we keep image generations to manageable sizes (1080p or 2K) and one scene at a time to avoid memory issues. If a scene has on-screen text (e.g. a title card), the text-to-image likely won’t replicate it accurately – we would handle that by generating a blank placeholder image and later overlaying the exact text manually. Kling/Veo models are cutting-edge for video, yet they are inherently limited to short durations and have a fixed output resolution (Kling 2.5 is up to 1080p
help.scenario.com
, Veo 3 similarly 1080p). If the final video needs higher resolution or longer length, an approach is to upscale the clips (using AI upscalers) and concatenate multiple segments. Another challenge is that these video models often do not allow fine editing once the clip is generated – if something is slightly off, one must regenerate or accept it. To alleviate this, our design generates small segments and keyframes so we have maximum control: we can always regenerate a single scene without redoing the entire video, and we can tweak keyframe images (even manually in Photoshop or using an image editor AI) to correct issues, then re-run the video generation for that scene.
Human Oversight and Creative Control: While the vision is an automated pipeline, in practice a human user will likely remain “in the loop” especially for creative decisions. The AI can propose prompts and produce content, but the user might spot if the “mood” isn’t quite right or if an important narrative element wasn’t captured. For example, if the original ad’s selling point is a brand logo appearing clearly, the user might need to ensure the AI-generated version places a similar-looking placeholder logo at that moment (perhaps by giving the image generation a reference of the logo or by planning to edit it in later). We consider making the system interactive: the user can review Gemini’s scene list and edit descriptions if needed before images are generated; similarly adjust prompts between image and video generation. Each agent thus assists the human creative director rather than working blindly. In essence, the AI agents handle the heavy lifting of content creation and technical details, while the human focuses on the creative alignment with the original video’s intent. Over time, as models improve, this process could become more fully automated, but currently this hybrid approach yields the best results.
Ethical and Quality Considerations: If recreating a video that involves real people or copyrighted content, one must consider the implications. Our pipeline generates everything from scratch – so the visuals will not be exact copies, but rather approximations (which might be desirable to avoid direct copying). There might be cases where the recreated video looks too different: e.g., the actor’s face is not the same. If fidelity is required, additional fine-tuning (training the image model on that actor’s face, etc.) would be an extra step. Moreover, if using the video for commercial purposes, ensure that the newly generated content does not inadvertently infringe on IP (for instance, if the AI unintentionally generates a very similar trademarked logo). From a technical standpoint, we also think about runtime performance: analyzing video with Gemini and generating many images/videos is computationally intensive. In a production setup, one would need robust hardware (Gemini requires cloud GPUs, Seed Dream 4.0 ideally runs on a high-VRAM GPU
aikolhub.com
, and Kling/Veo also need GPU acceleration). Batch processing and possibly parallelizing some steps (e.g. generating images for the next scene while a video clip is rendering for the current scene) could speed up the workflow.
In conclusion, this agent-based framework provides a comprehensive plan to deconstruct and reconstruct a video using AI. By breaking the task into specialized roles – understanding the video, writing prompts, generating images, then animating those images – we can tackle the complex problem of video recreation in manageable stages. Each agent leverages a state-of-the-art model (Gemini 2.5 for comprehension, Seed Dream 4.0 for visual fidelity, Kling/Veo for motion) playing to its strengths. The careful considerations around consistency, prompt engineering, and model limitations help ensure the final output is as close as possible to the original video’s content and creative style, effectively making the AI system a tireless assistant for the creative director in video production.
